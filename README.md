Team Roles
Data Pre-Processing & Cleaning(Sakshi & Justin):
Two team members are in charge of taking the data, 
filling in missing values, encoding categoricals, 
and normalizing values where appropriate.

Parametric Approach(Karan):
One team member is in charge of taking the cleaned and processed 
data and attempting to fit a regression model to it.

Non-Parametric(Henry):
The final member is going to build the knn model that we will
submit and use to predict from the cleaned and processed data

In addition to these roles, all team members built their own knn
models for practice and to see if they could improve at all.
